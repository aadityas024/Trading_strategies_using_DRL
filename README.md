# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Asset Price Forecasting and Trading Strategies

## Introduction
This project applies machine learning with a focus on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) using Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) to forecast asset prices and develop trading strategies. Unlike traditional supervised learning, MAPPO creates a collaborative learning environment where agents interact within a simulated market, optimizing their buy, sell, or hold actions. The goal is to build a model that enables adaptive trading decisions across stocks or mutual funds within different sectors.

## Model Workflow

### Data Collection
The foundation of the project involves gathering comprehensive data across multiple sectors:
- **Core Price Metrics**: Daily open, high, low, and close prices.
- **Trading Volume**: Indicates market participation and potential price shifts.
- **Key Financial Indicators**:
  - **Moving Averages (MA)**: Highlights long- and short-term trends.
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Assesses overbought or oversold conditions.
  - **Return Rates and Volatility**: Provides insights into historical performance and risk.
  - **Sharpe Ratio**: Evaluates risk-adjusted returns.
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - **Social Media and News Sentiment**: Reflects market sentiment to anticipate short-term effects.
- **Macroeconomic Indicators**:
  - **Interest and Inflation Rates**: Capture economic impacts on market behavior.
  - **GDP Growth Rates**: Provides insights into economic health.
- **Sector-Specific Metrics**: Tracks earnings growth and dividend yields by industry.

### Data Preprocessing
Raw data undergoes preprocessing to prepare it for MAPPO model input:
- **Scaling**: Standardizes data for enhanced model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Adds features such as moving averages, RSI, and other trend-capturing indicators.
- **Technical Indicators**: Constructs additional metrics like momentum to reflect market conditions.

### Model Selection: MAPPO
#### MAPPO Architecture
MAPPO enables multiple agents to interact within a simulated environment, learning optimal trading actions by coordinating buy, hold, or sell decisions.
1. **Define Project Scope**: Focus on forecasting asset prices and optimizing trading decisions across sectors using MAPPO.
2. **Select Sectors and Assets**: Identify key sectors (e.g., tech, finance, healthcare) and representative stocks or assets within each.
3. **Data Collection**: Collect essential metrics (open, high, low, close prices), trading volume, financial indicators, and sector-based macroeconomic data.
4. **Preprocess Data**: Standardize, normalize, and create sector-specific features such as inter-asset correlations.
5. **Agent Assignment**: Assign multiple agents to each sector, with each agent managing a specific asset or trading strategy.
6. **Set Up Environment**: Design a simulated market environment where agents can interact within and across sectors.
7. **Policy and Value Networks**: For each agent, implement a policy network that outputs actions (buy, sell, hold) and a value network that estimates the expected reward, enhancing stability.
8. **Reward Structure**: Design a reward system that considers both individual agent performance and sector-based portfolio performance, balancing profit and risk.
9. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune parameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and clipping ratio to enhance training stability and model performance.
10. **Backtesting**: Validate the modelâ€™s strategy on historical data, assessing both individual asset and overall sector performance.
11. **Optimization**: Use optimization techniques like grid search or random search and early stopping to refine performance, avoiding overfitting.
12. **Evaluation**: Conduct cross-validation and walk-forward testing to ensure the model generalizes well on new data.
13. **Risk Management**: Integrate sector-specific risk controls (position sizing, stop-loss) to minimize exposure to sudden market fluctuations.

## Model Setup
- **Agents**: Each agent represents trading decisions for a specific asset, allowing specialization within sectors.
- **Environment**: The market simulator incorporates price movements and sector interactions.
- **Reward Signal**: Profit or loss on trades drives rewards, with additional rewards for stable performance within and across sectors.

## Training the Model
MAPPO trains agents by simulating market interactions. Each agent refines its policy network, adjusting actions based on the expected value of rewards. Parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of episodes are tuned to optimize training.

## Backtesting
Backtesting simulates trading with historical data to measure how well agents adapt to past market conditions, evaluating individual sector performance and overall portfolio returns.

## Optimization
Model optimization includes tuning hyperparameters with methods like random search and early stopping, which prevent overfitting and enhance robustness in real-world trading.

## Evaluation and Deployment
The model undergoes cross-validation and walk-forward testing to verify accuracy on unseen data. Simulated paper trading enables real-time testing, providing a risk-free environment for evaluation.

## Conclusion
This project uses MAPPO in DRL to create a dynamic, multi-agent trading model. By analyzing agent interactions and optimizing trading strategies, the model adapts in real time to evolving market trends, supporting robust, data-driven trading across sectors.
